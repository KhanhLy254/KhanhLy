            <h1> This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</h1>
            <p> And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's. </p>
            <h2> Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this <br>shit.</h2>
            <h5> 7 fucking declarations.</h5>
            <p> That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href = "http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" > grotesque pile of shit </a> into this easy-to-read <br>masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass<br> website:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li> Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
                <li> Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
                <li>Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
                <li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
                <li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
            <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
            <h2> Let it breathe</h2>
            <p> Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not <br>married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <br><font  face="tahoma">line-height: 1.4</font> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see<br> that...piss off.</p>
            <p> If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that?<br> Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
            <h3> A little less contrast</h3>
            <p> Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a<br> bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <font  face="tahoma">#EEEEEE</font> if I wasn't so<br> focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
            <h3> Size Matters</h3>
            <p> I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to<br> 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
            <h3> Line-width, motherfucker</h3>
            <p> Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's <br>200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more<br> than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
            <h4> Yes, this is <i>also</i> fucking satire, you fuck</h4>
            <p> I love what the creator of <a href = "http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" > this site's inspiration </a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so<br> simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, <br>high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web<br> designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
